# Pricing

## sprocs Pricing

sprocs develops both free and commercial apps depending on the complexity and
ongoing maintenance needs of the particular app.

Apps listed as `Commercial` will only require a single subscription purchased
through the AWS Marketplace which grants access to all commercial sprocs for your personal or business use. Prices will depend on the size of your company and
desired level of support.

Apps are designated `Free` or `Commercial` in their respective documentation.

sprocs subscriptions are used to support ongoing development and maintenance of code, users are obviously responsible for their own AWS bill generated by sprocs usage on their
own account. Because sprocs use serverless AWS components, this amount will vary based on the app and the amount of usage but in general should
be far less than a comparable SaaS service would charge (as they typically charge per-seat).

Support services and integration consulting may be available to assist with setup, deployment, and maintenance if
needed. [Contact us](mailto:team@sprocs.com) to discuss.

## AWS Pricing

sprocs app usage will generate an AWS bill that is your responsibility (likely small for casual use but do your own diligence to price out your serverless use).

sprocs apps setup the following AWS tags on resources it creates `sprocs_app = APP_NAME` and `sprocs_env = AMPLIFY_ENV_HERE` for billing reporting purposes.

Setup `AWS Budget` notifications to monitor for unexpected serverless costs.

By using only serverless AWS resources, you only pay for what you use and not for idle time. Comparable SaaS offerings are almost always magnitudes more costly.
